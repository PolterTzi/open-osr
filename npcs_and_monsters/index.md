# NPCs and Monsters

## NPCs

The adventurers will meet many people during their lives - from the common people in towns, through bandits and travellers on the road, to humanoids living in the dungeons, they are all considered non-player characters, or NPC's for short.

When setting up the NPC's, you have to determine the race, class, level and equipment of such character - this will let you derive any relevant statistics. GM is allowed to make minor adjustments - just as the player characters have their boons and banes, NPC's can be given similar modifiers too.

### Level 0 characters

Many NPC's can be modelled as the level 0 characters. A level 0 character has the following 4 HP and +0 in attack bonus and all saving throws. This is modified by the racial traits.

## Monsters

Some beings can't be modelled as humanoids - starting from mundane animals, through giant ones and fantastical beings, and ending with undead, they are all called monsters within this game. This doesn't mean they are necessarily evil - it is merely a catch-all term for any being impossible to model as NPC.

### Lists of monsters

Each monster on this list will have a specified stat block in the following format:

|Level|HP|AC|Saves|Attacks|Special|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|4|11|+0/+0/+0|Claw +0 (1d4)|-|

The list of monsters is divided into few subsections, listed below:

* [Animals](animals)
* [Undead](undead)
* [Dragons](dragons)
* [Other fanstastic creatures](other)
