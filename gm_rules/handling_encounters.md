# Handling Encounters

The rules for the encounters given to the players are intentionally vague. Each GM may have a bit different way of handling encounters, which can be more or less complex. The following way of handling the encounters is merely a base to build upon, and are not hard rules that should trump common sense.

Whenever an encounter happens, the first thing the GM should check for is the surprise factor. In case of the placed encounters, usually neither side will be any more surprised than the other - exception being the planned attacks.

Afterwards, the reaction roll should be made - exception being mindless creatures that will always attack. To roll for reaction, make a 2d6 roll, add any relevant modifiers, then compare the result with the table below:
