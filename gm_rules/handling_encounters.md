# Handling Encounters

The rules for the encounters given to the players are intentionally vague. Each GM may have a bit different way of handling encounters, which can be more or less complex. The following way of handling the encounters is merely a base to build upon, and are not hard rules that should trump common sense.

Whenever an encounter happens, the first thing the GM should check for is the surprise factor. In case of the placed encounters, usually neither side will be any more surprised than the other - exception being the planned attacks.
