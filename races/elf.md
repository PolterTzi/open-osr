# Elf

Elves are at a first glance similar to humans - not counting the slimmer body, larger eyes, and pointed ears, one could even mistake an elf for human. But the differences go way further than that.

The first, and the most important difference is that elves have an unlimited lifespan. They can't die from old age, but this slow paced lifespan does come at a cost. First, elves reach their physical maturity when they are about 80 years old. This slow-paced lifespan additionally results in a larger suspectibility to wounds and slower regeneration. On the other hand, having the life functions slowed in this way comes with benefits too - Elves require less food, water and sleep to live. (TODO: write better)

Elves have a deep connection with magic.
