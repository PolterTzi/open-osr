# Human

Humans are, well... humans. They are pretty much the same in the real world and in the fantasy world. At a first glance, humans are mundane - they magical like elves, they aren't as resilient as dwarves, and they aren't as nimble as halflings. And yet, they have one thing that gives them an edge over the other races - they are extremely adaptable. While they won't reach the levels of mastery that other races are able to, they learn faster than most, and more than most.

## Traits:

* Starting age: `2d6+14`
* Known languages: 
    * Common
    * +1 bonus language
* Maximum level is reduced to 8.
* Ability to multiclass:
    * If a human has a level 3 in their chosen class or higher, they may chose to begin training in a second class.
    * If the first class provides the human with spell slots, such human may not choose a second class that provides spell slots - for example, it is impossible to create a Wizard/Cleric multiclass character.
    * After starting the multiclass training, the human reaches a level 0 in the chosen class. Level 0 gives no benefits nor class features, but if the class has an anathema, it takes an effect.
    * The experience and levels are tracked separately for each class. Each class gains half of the normally gained experience points, even if either class is already at the level 8.
    * To reach level 1 in the second class, human needs to gain 2500 experience points in it. After reaching the level 1, the experience point count of this class is reset back to zero, with any leftover XP being wasted.
    * A multiclassing human uses the higher HP, Attack and saves from the two classes used by them.
