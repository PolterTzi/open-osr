# Rogue

(TODO: Fluff)

Rogues are sneaky tricksters. While they know their way around the weapon use, they are not keen on fighting on the frontlines - they prefer to be unseen.

## Equipment

The Rogue can use any weapon effectively and without any issue, but they are limited to the light armor. If they are wearing medium or heavy armor, they are unable to effectively use their special abilities. Shield use may also impair certain uses of their special abilities at GM's discretion.

All Rogues

## Special Abilities

* Rogues have access to a set of thief skills. Each of these skills has a set chance of success based on level and any other relevant factors. The list of thief skills is as follows:
    * Stealth (S) - Stealth allows the Rogue to hide and move silently even in difficult situations. The GM should make a roll for the use of this ability in secret, because the Rogue won't be able to know whether or not their attempt is successful - until it's too late.
    * Climb Surfaces (CS) - While any player character can climb jagged walls, Rogues have the seemingly supernatural ability to climb flat surfaces with no apparent way to cling onto them. A roll should be mad
    * Disable Device (DD) - Rogues may tinker with traps and other mechanical devices to disable them. In case of traps, the failure means activating the trap.
    * Open Lock (OL) - Rogues can open mechanical locks provided they have the tools to do so.
    * Pickpocket (PP) - 
    * Hear Noise (HN) -
* Sneak attack - whenever Rogue performs an attack that their target can't reasonably expect, they gain an additional +4 bonus to their attack roll, and deal a doubled amount of damage on a successful hit.
* Starting from level 6, Rogues can "fake" the ability to use magic to be able to use magic scrolls - which normally can be used only by spellcasters. Such use of scrolls is inconsistent, with multiple attempts often being necessary for the spell to be properly cast. The highest Spell Tier of a spell cast this way may be 3rd, and the chance of a successful cast is dependent on level and the Spell Tier. Provided there is no time pressure, and the chance of success is higher than zero, there is no need to roll for success - given enough time the Rogue will succeed anyway.
