# Fighter

Fighters specialize in physical combat - they are precise with their weapons, and very resistant to most forms of damage. While at the first glance their abilities seem mundane, in practice their skill with weapon is extraordinary and is unmatched by any other class.

## Equipment

Fighters can use any simple or martial weapon and any armor effectively.

## Class abilities

* Starting from level 6, Fighters gain the ability to attack twice in a single turn, with second attack having its attack bonus reduced by 5.
