# Monk

The monks are rarely found wanderers, the ascets seeking to discard the need for the earthly desires. Through meditation and physical training they seek to surpass the limitations of their physical self, and seek the ability to combine their soul with their body.

> **Designer Commentary**: In most interpretations of this class Monks are "just" the spiritual martial artists - likely also being able to use Ki to perform what is effectively casting reflavored spells. Here I decided to push this class in a slightly different direction - the ascets trying to reach true perfection.
> 
> Due to how the bulk of experience is awarded through treasure, it is advised that no more than a single Monk will travel in a single party.

## Equipment

Monks beliefs forbid them from having more equipment than they need. The following rules are used:

* The monk may only wear simple clothing. They may not wear any armor nor magic items.
* The monk is allowed to carry at most a single day worth of food and water at any given time.
* The monk is allowed to carry a single holy symbol of their faith.
* The monk may not carry nor use any magic items. They are still allowed to be a target of spells and magic items - for example, they are allowed to drink a healing potion given to them by someone else.
* The monk may carry up to 10 gp in money.
* If multiclassing with a spellcasting class, they may carry and use a single spellbook with them, but only if it is necessary to prepare and cast spells.
* The monk may not have any possessions of his own outside of what they carry with themselves, nor they may possess anything not listed above - not even the sources of light.

Breaking the rules above will result in the loss of class abilities that are marked as `[Spiritual]` and halt the class progression - additionally, any XP gained in this class will be wasted until the atonement - see **Monk's Atonement** in the Special Rules section below.

The monk's starting gold is reduced to `3d3` gp.

## Class abilities

* Monks can deal lethal damage through unarmed attacks. Whenever they hit the target using unarmed attacks, they deal 1d6 damage. They can also successfully attack armored opponents this way.
* Monks have access to a limited set of thief skills - see the [Rogue](rogue) class for description of these skills. The thief skills Monks have access to are: Stealth (S), Climb Surfaces (CS) and Hear Noise (HN).
* `[Spiritual]` Starting from level 2, Monks' unarmed attacks count as attacks made using a silver weapon for the purposes of overcoming the resistances only.
* `[Spiritual]` Starting from level 2, Monks need only half as much food and water as a normal person would to survive. At level 6, Monks stop to have any need for food and water whatsoever - they can surive without them without any penalties.
* `[Spiritual]` Starting from level 3, Monks can't be forced to break their ascetic lifestyle through magical means. Any magical enchantments, such as Charm Person, Geas, or Quest will be instantly broken if they would result in the Monk gaining unnecessary possesions.
* Starting from level 3, Monks gain the ability to make an unarmed attack twice in a single turn. The amount of unarmed attacks per turn three at level 5, and four at level 7.
* `[Spiritual]` Starting from level 4, Monks' unarmed attacks count as attacks made using a +1 weapon for the purposes of overcoming the resistances only. This improves to +2 at level 6, and to +3 at level 8.
* `[Spiritual]` Starting from level 4 Monks need only the half of the normal amount of sleep to be well rested. At level 8 they no longer need sleep at all.
* `[Spiritual]` Starting from level 5 Monks gain the ability to heal themselves once per day. To do so, they need to meditate for several minutes. The amount of HP they heal is equal to `1d6+level`, and additionally using this ability has a 50% chance to heal any diseases they may have (roll for each disease separately). At level 9 they can use this ability twice per day.
* `[Spiritual]` At level 8, Monks no longer age. This makes it impossible for them to die from the old age.
* `[Spiritual]` After reaching level 10, the Monk can attempt to merge their soul and body - see **Merging the soul and body** in the Special rules section below.

## Special rules

### Monk's atonement

The atonement first requires the monk to discard their unnecessary possesions

### Breaking the level cap

Certain races are subject to lower experience level limit, which in turn means they can't reach the maximum level of 10 and attain their ultimate goal of merging their soul and body. At GM's discretion, such Monks may be allowed to break this limitation under the following rules:

* They are not a multiclass character.
* After reaching their level limit, they have to perform an uninterrupted meditation for at least an entire month.
* After performing such meditation, such Monk loses all XP they have, while retaining their experience level. In this state, they will gain XP at a halved rate. Additionally, they lose any ability that would allow them to multiclass, if they had any.
* If during this period the Monk will break their ascetic lifestyle, they will irrevocably lose access to their class abilities that are marked as `[Spiritual]`, and will no longer be able to gain any additional XP. This can't be reversed even through atonement. 

### Merging the soul and body

After merging their soul and body, the Monk counts as a level 11 character, with the following statistics:
|HP|Attack|Body Save|Reflex Save|Magic Save|Unarmed Attacks|AC|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|36|+9|+10|+10|+10|4x, +3|21|

The chance of success for thief skills are increased to the following values:

|S|CS|HN|
|-|-|-|
|99|100|99|

Additionally, they gain following traits:

* They can't be damaged through non-magical means.
* They can regenerate all damage taken through a 24 hour long meditation.
* They become immune to any poisons and diseases.
* They become immune to any mind altering effects.
* They become physically and mentally unable to have any possessions except for the simple clothing they have worn during the ritual. They can't break this rule - not even consciously.
* After death, their soul will be destroyed - as such, they can't be resurrected via any means.
