# Classes

## Core Classes

These are the four archetypal classes that exist in a wide variety of OSR games. These classes are suitable for new players, and most OSR modules expect these classes to exist at least in some form.

* [Cleric](cleric)
* [Fighter](fighter)
* [Rogue](rogue)
* [Wizard](wizard)

## Advanced Classes

These are the classes that will fit in many campaigns in one way or another. They are often variants of the Core classes listed above. They are usually a bit more complex compared to the Core Classes, but they aren't overwhelmingly so.

* [Barbarian](barbarian)
* [Dark Cleric](dark_cleric)
* [Sorcerer](sorcerer)
* [Assassin](assassin)

## Special Classes

These are classes that come with a high degree of complexity or are very specific. They may also be considerably weird - and as such unfit for many settings.

* [Monk](monk)
