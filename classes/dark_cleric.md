## Equipment

Dark clerics can use any simple or martial weapon and any armor effectively, including the slashing and piercing weapons.

All Dark clerics start with a free holy symbol related to their beliefs.

Whenever the Dark Cleric wishes to use this ability, they make an unmodified d20 roll to determine the max level of turned undead. The required minimum roll is based on the cleric's level and is listed in the table below. Empty value means that the undead of this level are too strong to be repelled. This ability can be used only once per minute.

* Starting from level 2, clerics gain the ability to cast dark divine spells.
