# Barbarian

Barbarians are warriors of the wilderness. They come from harsh enviroments, surviving with their sheer strength and willpower. Many of them are known to protect their tribes, but some of them are travelling alone through the lands. One thing that is common with all Barbarians though, is their primal instinct that they can draw upon in the form of rage - giving them an immense strenght, reflexes and resillience.

Barbarians find the so-called civillization incredibly constraining and uncomfortable. While they are usually fine with small villages, they feel that building large settlements results in the humanity going against their own nature. While they can visit cities if they have to do so, they will feel a serious discomfort and will try to get back into the wilderness as soon as they possibly can.

## Equipment

Barbarians can use any simple or martial weapon effectively. They are restricted to the light armor - medium or heavy armor will restrict their abilities, dulling their primal instinct and disabling their class abilities. Prolonged use of medium or heavy armor may result in a permanent loss of these class abilities.

## Class abilities

* Barbarians have the ability to enter the state of Rage. Such state lasts for a single minute, after which the rage can't be activated for at least 10 minutes. Additionally, the Barbarians can enter this state a limited amount of times per day, starting at 2, then increasing by 1 at every even level. During the rage, Barbarians gain the following benefits:
    * +2 to the attack bonus
    * +2 to all saving throw rolls
    * All incoming damage is reduced by 1. This allows to negate the damage completely.
    * The damage dealt is increased +2, and starting from level 3 increased by an additional +1 every odd level.
* Provided they don't wear medium or heavy armor, Barbarians gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class. This bonus is increased to +3 at level 4, and to +4 at level 8.
