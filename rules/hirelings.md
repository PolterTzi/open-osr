# Hirelings

It is unlikely that the adventurers will be able to do everything by themselves, and will usually need to employ the services of other people. There are a few types of such hirelings.

## Retainers

Retainers are non-player characters that the player characters can hire as the adventuring partners. They are loyal, and will follow the employer even into dungeons, and will follow most orders. In practice, this comes down to the fact that the player is playing as multiple characters at once - but GM should step in and make the retainer refuse in case of obviously suicidal orders.

To recruit a retainer, the player character has to first spend some time looking for potential candidates, which usually takes about a day. The retainers will usually start as level 1 characters, created by the GM, and they will expect to receive half the treasure share from the adventures. Additionally, the employer will have to provide the equipment to the retainer, as well as a customary payment upfront, usually ranging from 10 to 100 gc.

If the employer dies, generally at the strongest retainer will be promoted to the role of a full member of the adventuring party, with them becoming the new player character. They should have the priority to loot the employer's corpse before other party members. Rest of the retainers may follow the promoted party member if they are of lower level - otherwise they are likely to leave.

In most cases, a level 1 adventurer won't be able to hire anyone due to the lack of power and acclaim, but GM should consider allowing this in case of small adventuring parties or even solo adventurers.

## Experts

Adventurers may require the service of artisans, scholars or spellcasters. For the first two the price of hiring such people usually is between 1 and 10 gc per day. For spellcasters though, it all depends on the Tier of the spell the adventurers wish to be casted:

|Tier|Price|
|-|-|
|1|100gc|
|2|300gc|
|3|900gc|
|4|1500gc|
|5|4000gc|
