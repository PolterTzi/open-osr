# Combat

## Scale of time

The combat is divided into rounds, with each of them representing about 6 seconds of time. During a round each side of combat takes their turn - with players assumed to move first, with opponent side moving afterwards.

## Initiative

Whenever the combat starts, players have to perform an initiative roll. To do so, each player rolls 1d6. If any of the players rolls 3 or less, they have to skip their actions during the first turn - 4 or more means they can move normally. 

An extra bonus up to +2 or a penalty up to -2 may be applied to the initiative in case of surprise or any other relevant factors.

## Armor Class and Hit Points

Armor Class (AC) determines how hard it is to damage you - it is based on your armor and any other bonuses.

Hit Points (HP) determines how much damage can you withstand. Every point of damage dealt to you means the loss of 1 HP. It is based on your class choice, level, and any other bonuses.

## Character's turn

During a turn, a character can typically perform a single action and move a short distance - about 12 meters in normal circumstances, and 9 meters for encumbered characters. Example actions are listed below.

### Attack

To attack, make a `d20+ability bonus+Combat Bonus` roll. The added ability bonus comes from STR for melee attacks, and from DEX for ranged attacks. Attacking from behind grants an additional +2 bonus to the roll. If the attack roll is equal or higher than the target's Armor Class, the attack is successful - roll for damage based on the weapon you have and apply any relevant modifiers you have.

### Ranged attack specifics

Ranged attacks have a limited range. The range listed by the weapon type is the effective range, for which there is no penalty to attack. The maximum range is double the effective range. Attacking someone further than the effective range has a -3 attack roll penalty. It is also difficult to fight using ranged weapons in melee range - in this case the -3 penalty applies too.

### Reloading

Crossbows have to be reloaded between attacks. To reload a light crossbow, you have to spend your action. To reload the heavy crossbow, you have to spend your whole turn, meaning you can't additionally move.

### Run

Instead of attacking, you can move up to your base speed in metres again, resulting in the doubled movement speed in this round.

### Cast Spell

If you are a spellcaster, you can cast one of your prepared spells. To do so, you need to have at least one hand free, and you need the ability to speak. If you are next to an enemy, there is a 1 in 4 chance that your spell will fail and be wasted due to disruption.

### Charging attack

You run in the straight line to your opponent and attack. You can move up to the double your base speed in metres, but you have to run for at least 2 metres. Charging attack is done with an additional +2 bonus. This functions both as a move and action.

### Defensive movement

If a character moves out of an opponent's melee range, he is allowed to make an extra attack against you, even if the opponent has already attacked in this round. Opponents with multiple attacks must choose only one attack for this case.

The character can avoid this by using defensive movement. In this case, they lose their action for the turn, and they can only move up to half of the normal distance in metres.

### Defensive stance

Instead of moving and taking an action, a combat participant may just decide to defend. Skipping a turn this way grants +4 AC until the start of character's next turn.

### Unarmed attacks

Unarmed attacks deal d3 damage on hit, and they can't deal damage to opponents in chain or plate armor. Normally, they can only cause someone to become unconscious, but it is possible to beat someone to death at GM's discretion.

### Holy water

A vial of holy water can be thrown on the undead creature. When it hits the ground or a monster, it deals 1d8 damage to undead in the 2 meter radius. Directly hit undead monsters takes an additional 1d8.

### Oil

> **Developer commentary:** Some GM's allow using flasks of oil in a grenade-like fashion. While it does sound like a cool thing to do, it isn't exactly the most realistic thing, and it can kinda trivialize the encounters - and if you will make enemies use the "oil grenades", combat becomes extremely volatile. For these reasons, the rules don't support such use of the oil.

A flask on oil can be poured onto the ground and set ablaze. Such oil will burn for about a minute (6 rounds) and can be used to block off a corridor up to 3 meters wide. Attempting to pass through such blockade will result in taking d6 damage

Flask of oil spilled on the ground can burn up to 12 rounds (2 minutes). Anyone trying to pass it will take 1d8 damage from the flames.

## Natural healing and rest

Each day, a rested character naturally heals 1 HP. A rested character needs at least 6 hour of sleep. Characters that lack sleep have a -1 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws per each day of sleeplessness.

## Death

> **Designer Commentary:** In the original games, if you dropped down to zero HP, you were dead and usually had to roll a new character. I like to give the players a little bit of leeway when it comes to this, and as such I allow a death save with a low chance of success.

If a someone's HP reaches 0, it usually means they are dead. Nonlethal damage will result in the target falling unconsious instead for a span of 1d6 hours.

Player characters reduced to zero HP are allowed to perform a death save. When this happens, make an unmodified d20 roll, and add any excess damage taken to the result. If the result of the is 10 or more, the character is dead. Otherwise, the character falls unconscious and requires first aid to be administered in a span of 1d4 minutes - otherwise the character will die. Stabilizing the character through mundane means will let the character wake up with 1 HP after. Magical healing will result in the character waking up after 3d6 minutes.

## Energy Drain

> **Designer Commentary:** In the original games there was a similar mechanic called level drain - and it was permanent. I dislike this for two reasons: first, it is extremely frustrating to lose levels and be forced to regain them; second, it causes quite a bit of bookkeeping; and third, it just feels wrong to remove what is essentially the learned memory. It is still necessary to include some form of this  mechanic though for both compatibility and flavor reasons - high level undead creatures rely on this mechanic to strike fear even in the most powerful adventurers.

> The implementation of this mechanic is a bit more "modern", and paradoxically both less and more temporary. Anyone can recover a negative level, even if they stay away from adventuring - after all they don't forget what they know. On the other hand, a day worth of adventuring won't be enough to revert this effect - energy drain is a curse that has to be dealt through through either a long wait or through powerful magic.

Some monsters cause energy drain. Every energy drain effect causes one negative level. Each negative level has these effects:

* -5 to both current and maximum amounts of HP
* -1 to all attack rolls and saving throws

One negative level can be recovered through natural means at a rate of one per month.
