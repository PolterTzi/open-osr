# Exploration

## Party order

Players should decide on their marching order for the exploration periods. For example, a group may decide to have a Fighter and a Cleric in the front, Wizard in the middle, and a Rogue in the back.

## Dungeon exploration

### Scale of time

During dungeon exploration, an exploration turn is used. One exploration turn roughly represents a period of 10 minutes.

### Movement

When moving through the unknown parts of the dungeon, the characters move at a rate of 90m per exploration turn. While this may seem extremely slow, this takes into account the mapping, as well as the utmost carefulness of the adventurers in the unknown and hostile enviroment. This rate of movement allows the adventuring party to notice any oddities even under the torchlight, and keep themselves reasonably silent. In the already explored areas, characters will usually move significiantly faster.

Encumbered characters move at half the normal rate.

### Resources

It is important to track the amount of resources during the dungeon exploration - especially the time and lightsources. Each torch can last for about an hour (6 exploration turns) before it goes off, while lanterns can provide light for about 3 hours (18 exploration turns) with a single vial of oil.

### Random encounters

Each dungeon level will have its own random encounter table. If not specified otherwise, each hour the GM should roll a d6. If 1 or 2 is rolled, a random encounter happens. This roll should be done if the party makes a lot of noise, or otherwise try to bring attention to themselves. 

## Wilderness exploration

### Scale of time

During wilderness exploration, the game is taken on a day by day basis.

### Movement

The standard rate of movement for the adventuring party is 5 kilometers per hour. Weather and terrain may reduce this speed though, and mounts can be used to increase it.

Under normal circumstances, the party will spend 8 hours on travel, 8 hours on the night sleep, and the rest of the time on eating, hunting, and otherwise resting. The party may decide to force themselves to spend more time on marching instead of resting. Each hour of marching beyond the 8th in a single day will force the character to take 1 non-lethal damage. Starting from the 12th hour, this is increased to 1d6 lethal damage per each hour.

Encumbered characters move at half the normal rate.

### Random encounters

In wilderness, a random encounter check should be done roughly every four hours of ingame time - the GM should roll a d6 for each of these periods of time, and initiate a random encounter on a roll of 1. On the main, commonly used roads the frequency of the random encounters can be increased at GM's discretion.

Safer areas will often have more traders and peaceful travellers, while the more dangerous ones will often pit player characters in danger. Additionally, random encounters at night are usually more dangerous than the ones at day.

## Encounters

During exploration periods the adventuring party will often encounter other living beings. They may be some kind of travellers, animals, bandits, monsters - and rarely even a different adventurer party! Whenever an encounter happens, GM will roll for each side whether you noticed each other, as well as roll for the reaction. In many cases you will be able to avoid combat, either via a diplomatic approach or a simple evasive action.

At the start of the encounter, the GM will usually make a reaction roll. The "party face" can affect this roll by applying a positive or a negative modifier to the reaction roll, and the actions undertaken by the adventuring party can provide an additional set of modifiers.
