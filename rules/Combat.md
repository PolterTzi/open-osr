# Combat

## Scale of time

The combat is divided into rounds, with each of them representing about 6 seconds of time. During a round each side of combat takes their turn - with players assumed to move first, with opponent side moving afterwards.

## Initiative

Whenever the combat starts, players have to perform an initiative roll. To do so, each player rolls 1d6. If any of the players rolls 3 or less, they have to skip their actions during the first turn - 4 or more means they can move normally. 

An extra bonus up to +2 or a penalty up to -2 may be applied to the initiative in case of surprise or any other relevant factors.

## Armor Class and Hit Points

Armor Class (AC) determines how hard it is to damage you - it is based on your armor and any other bonuses.

Hit Points (HP) determines how much damage can you withstand. Every point of damage dealt to you means the loss of 1 HP. It is based on your class choice, level, and any other bonuses.

## Character's turn

During a turn, a character can typically perform a single action and move up to their base speed in metres. Example actions are listed below.

### Attack

To attack, make a `d20+ability bonus+Combat Bonus` roll. The added ability bonus comes from STR for melee attacks, and from DEX for ranged attacks. Attacking from behind grants an additional +2 bonus to the roll. If the attack roll is equal or higher than the target's Armor Class, the attack is successful - roll for damage based on the weapon you have and apply any relevant modifiers you have.

### Ranged attack specifics

Ranged attacks have a limited range. The range listed by the weapon type is the effective range, for which there is no penalty to attack. The maximum range is double the effective range. Attacking someone further than the effective range has a -3 attack roll penalty. It is also difficult to fight using ranged weapons in melee range - in this case the -3 penalty applies too.

### Reloading

Crossbows have to be reloaded between attacks. To reload a light crossbow, you have to spend your action. To reload the heavy crossbow, you have to spend your whole turn, meaning you can't additionally move.

### Run

Instead of attacking, you can move up to your base speed in metres again, resulting in the doubled movement speed in this round.

### Cast Spell

If you are a spellcaster, you can cast one of your prepared spells. To do so, you need to have at least one hand free, and you need the ability to speak. If you are next to an enemy, there is a 1 in 4 chance that your spell will fail and be wasted due to disruption.

### Charging attack

You run in the straight line to your opponent and attack. You can move up to the double your base speed in metres, but you have to run for at least 2 metres. Charging attack is done with an additional +2 bonus. This functions both as a move and action.

### Defensive movement

If a character moves out of an opponent's melee range, he is allowed to make an attack against you with +2 attack bonus, even if the opponent has already attacked in this round. Opponents with multiple attacks must choose only one attack for this case.

The character can avoid this by using defensive movement. In this case, they lose their action for the turn, and they can only move up to half of their base speed in metres.

### Defensive stance

Instead of moving and taking an action, a combat participant may just decide to defend. Skipping a turn this way grants +4 AC until the start of character's next turn.

### Normal men

Normal men are zero-level characters. They have 1d4 HP, and have 10 in all stats, and their Combat Bonus is +0. Because of their lack of weapon experience, they have -4 attack penalty when using weapons other than darts, daggers, clubs, staffs or quarterstaffs.

### Unarmed attacks

Unarmed attacks deal d3 damage on hit, and they can't deal damage to opponents in chain or plate armor. Normally, they can only cause someone to become unconscious, but it is possible to beat someone to death at GM's discretion.

### Holy water

A vial of holy water can be thrown on the undead creature. When it hits the ground or a monster, it deals 1d8 damage to undead in the 2 meter radius. Directly hit undead monsters takes an additional 1d8.

### Oil

A flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like weapon. The oil has to be set on fire to deal damage. A being that is burning this way takes 1d8 damage per turn until the fire is put out. The effect shouldn't last more than 3 rounds.

Flask of oil spilled on the ground can burn up to 12 rounds (2 minutes). Anyone trying to pass it will take 1d8 damage from the flames.

## Natural healing and rest

Each day, a rested character naturally heals 1 HP. A rested character needs at least 6 hour of sleep. Characters that lack sleep have a -1 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws per each day of sleeplessness.

## Death

If a character's HP reaches 0, it usually means he or she is dead. GM may say otherwise depending on circumstances, for example when using unarmed attacks or the target of attacks is only meant to be put unconsicious.

Player characters reduced to zero HP can perform a death save. When this happens, make an unmodified d20 roll, and compare it to the death save difficulty - which is 10+excess damage. If the excess damage is 11 or higher, the death is instant.

If the death save is successful, the character falls unconscious instead of dead,has their max HP reduced by 1, and one of their Abilities - randomly chosen by a dice roll - is also permanently reduced by 1. If the max HP is reduced below 1, or if any ability scores are reduced below 3, the death happens in 1d4 hours and cannot be prevented. Additionally, resurrection magic won't work for such a character.

Under normal circumstances, the character will die in 3d6 hours if unattended, or restore back to 1 HP after 1d4+1 days under medical care. If magically healed, the character will wake up in 3d6 minutes.

## Energy Drain

Some monsters cause energy drain. Every energy drain effect causes one Negative Level. Each negative level has these effects:

* Loss of equivalent of 1 level of hitpoints. (TODO)

* -1 to all attack rolls and saving throws

One negative level can be regenerated per week. A Remove Curse spell instantly regenerates one negative level. If a character has at least as many negative levels as their experience levels, they instantly die. Usually they rise up as an undead creature on the next night.
