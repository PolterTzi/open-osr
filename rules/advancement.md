# Advancement

Each and every adventure that the player characters will survive causes them to grow in power. As with many other RPG systems, this is done through experience points (XP).

## Awarding XP

At the end of each game session, the total amount of XP gained by the party is tallied up and split evenly between all participating player characters. Retainers count as half a player character for this purpose only, and get half a share. 

**Example**: Let's saty a party consisting of 2 player characters and 4 retainers earns 1000xp. The XP has to be split into 2 full shares, and 4 half-shares. A full share, given to each player character is equal to `1000/(2+4/2) = 250` XP - while the half-share, given to the retainers, is 125 XP.

There are several ways to earn the XP.

### Treasure

The main source of experience points is gaining treasure. Each gp gained through adventuring equals 1 XP. The adventuring party has to bring the treasure to a safe place to be able to claim it as their own and gain experience this way. Not every coin earned counts through - the characters have to put some effort and usually also risk their lives to actually earn the experience. Money gained through mundane work doesn't count, as well as magical treasure - even if sold.

### Defeating enemies

All enemies defeated by the party contributes to the amount of XP gained. Defeating enemy doesn't have to mean killing them - any victory over the hostiles should count, including outsmarting, capturing or scaring them away.

> **Designer Commentary**: Combat is not meant to be the main way to gain XP points - and as such the amount of XP gained for slaying the enemies is small. Even then, it is still not as extreme as it was in the original games, which could as well not provide any XP for defeating enemies and most people wouldn't see a difference.

> In OpenOSR, I went for a bit more rewarding reward curve to provide some additional incentive to be brave, while not pushing it to the point where murdering everything and everyone is the way to go for the players - hence why it is comparably higher than the originals.

To determine the exact amount of XP gained this way, total the XP for each defeated enemy, based on the table below:

|Enemy level|XP|
|-|-|
|0|10|
|1|25|
|2|40|
|3|90|
|4|200|
|5|450|
|6|950|
|7|2000|
|8|3200|
|9|4500|
|10|6000|
|11|8000|
|12|10000|
|13|12000|
|14|14000|
|15|16000|

### Bonus awards

The Game Master has the option to provide players with additional XP for major successes - such as achieving plot goals, or performing extraordinary feats. The amount of XP for such cases is left to the GM's discretion.
