# Downtime

## Cost of living

Adventurers can usually live in towns or villages for "free", provided they will do some work - otherwise, they will usually need to pay 3gp per day for both food and room in inn.

## Residence

Adventurers may decide to settle down in a house in a town or village - such house can be either built or bought. This provides a stable place to live, providing the adventurer with a minor rise of status and ability to store treasure and items. You will be also forced to pay taxes to the ruler of the land. The following prices are listed as reference:

|Housing|Price|Tax and upkeep|

## Stronghold

High level characters may claim a part of land as their own, and raise their stronghold. There are two ways to obtain a stronghold - the first way is gaining control over the existing one, the second is building your own. Building a stronghold requires spending at least 50000 gc and 1 years.

Owner of a stronghold is a de facto ruler of the nearby land - they may be a vassal to a more powerful ruler (for example a duke under command of a king), which will require the vassal to pay taxes and answer calls to arms in exchange for protection. Estabilishing a new stronghold is bound to bring attention to rival forces seeking to thwart this plan.

More detail about strongholds is available in the [Strongholds](strongholds) section.
