# Equipment

## Money

### Coins

Most common form of money that will be used by adventurers comes in the form of coins - small pieces of metal. The most common materials that coins are made from are gold, silver and copper, with the following conversion rates between them:
```
1 gc (gold coins) = 10 sc (silver coins) = 100 cc (copper coins)
```
Some regions may use different forms of coinage - but the gold/silver/copper system is accepted nearly everywhere.

### Gems

Carrying and counting large amounts of coinage is difficult - and for this reason many large sum transactions use valuable gems instead of coins. For simplicity sake the following values may be used:

|Gem size|Value|
|-|-|
|Small|20gc|
|Medium|100gc|
|Large|500gc|

## Encumbrance

Typically, a normal player character has 10 equipment slots available to them, but bonuses and penalties may apply to this value. Each item in the character's possesion takes up a certain amount of slots - which is an abstraction of both the weight and unwieldness of the item.

### Assumptions

Characters are assumed to have some kind of clothing and a container for items - such as a sack or a backpack. These assumed items do not count towards the equipment slot limit.

### Quick access slots

The first three inventory slots are the quick access slots - items that you have an immediate access to. During combat or any other situations with time pressure, you can easily grab these items and use them in the same turn. For example, these may be a weapon that you quickly ready up at the start of the combat, ammo for ranged weapons, a magic scroll with an useful combat spell, and so on. Any items in the other slots require looking through the belongings and need at least a full combat turn to retrieve.

### Stackable items

Common stackable items are:

* Coins - up to 50 per slot
* Small gems - up to 5 per slot
* Medium gems - up to 2 per slot
* Arrows or Crossbow bolts - up to 12 per slot
* Torches - up to 6 per slot
* Food rations - up to 7 days worth per slot

### Large items

Some items, especially the armor, are too heavy or unwieldy to justify using just a single slot for them. Such items

### Armor

Armor is unique in this regard that you only have to wear it to benefit from its protection. You don't need to place armor in the Quick access slots - you only have to mark it as currently worn.

### Exceeding the amount of slots

If there is a need to do so, characters may temporarily carry more items than their amount of equipment slots would normally allow them to do. Exceeding the item slot limit by up to 5 will result in your character being Encumbered, which halves your base movement rate. Exceeding it even further immobilizes you and may result in you getting slowly crushed under the weight of your equipment.
