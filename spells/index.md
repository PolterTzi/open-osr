# Spells

Some characters and monsters have the ability to use magic. Such magic exists in the form of codified spells with predetermined effect. Spellcasters prepare spells through commiting patterns of magical energy to their mind - this is called "memorizing" spells. Afterwards, they can cast the spell, which causes them to "forget" the spell.

## Rules of magic

### Memorizing spells

Spellcasters can memorize spells whenever they have a "fresh mind" - that is after a proper rest. They have a set amount of spell slots that they can fill with spells, each of them capable of holding a spell of a specific tier. Spellcasters can memorize the same spell multiple times to be able to cast it multiple times.

Memorizing spells takes about one hour for all spell slots. It is possible to left some slots empty, or retain the spells from the previous day to shorten the time - for example, it should only take half an hour to

### Casting spells

Certain spells allow for the saving throw to either reduce or resist the effect of the spell. 

### Spontaneous casting

Certain classes can cast spells in a spontaneous way. Instead of memorizing and forgetting the spells like any other spellcaster, they have their repetitoire permamently ingrained in their memory. Whenever they cast a spell, they expend the spell slot of the respective tier. For example, if such caster knew 3 spells of Tier 1, they could use a Tier 1 spell slot to cast any of these 3 spells.

The main drawback of spontaneous casting is the fact that the repetitoire can't be changed.

### Spellbooks

Spellcasters may require spellbooks to memorize the spells from. Such spellcasters are linked to their spellbooks on the personal level and can only use their own spellbooks. There are two reasons for this: first, every caster devises their own way to write spells in their spellbook, and the second reason is the fact that there are minor differences between the actual structure of the spells between each caster. While two Wizards may know the same Magic Arrow spell, they

Losing the spellbook cripples such spellcaster, and oftentimes Wizards prepare backup spellbooks. If no backup is available, then the spellcaster has to recreate this book from the scratch. The process is similar to researching the spells by yourself, but it requires ten times less money and can be done without access to a laboratory.

To register a new spell into the spellbook, one has to research the spell. Doing so requires a large amount of money in the form of gems, which will be consumed in the process. Additionally the spellcaster has to have an access to a private laboratory or to a teacher. The laboratory has to be merely a permanent residence of the spellcaster - it doesn't have to be well-stocked, but it has to be a place that the spellcaster is connected to. Having an access to a teacher or someone's else spellbook with the spell researched halves the amount of consumed gems. The price and time required are as follows:

|Spell Tier|Cost|Time|
|-|-|-|
|1|1000gp|1 week|
|2|2000gp|2 weeks|
|3|4000gp|3 weeks|
|4|6000gp|4 weeks|
|5|10000gp|6 weeks|
