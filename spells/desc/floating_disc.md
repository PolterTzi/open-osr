# Floating Disc

* **Range**: 10m + 1m per caster level
* **Duration**: 1 hour

The caster conjures a slightly concave, circular disc. This disc has a diameter of 2 meters and is just a few centimeters deep at the center. It can carry up to about 250 kg of weight.

This disc moves according to the caster's wishes, at a speed equivalent to half the speed of an unencumbered character, and it can't float higher than 1 meter above the ground. If the disc is moved outside the spell's range, the spell instantly breaks. The caster may also dispel this spell at any moment.

When the spell breaks, all objects placed on the disc will fall on the ground.
