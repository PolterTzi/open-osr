# Charm Person

* **Range**: 30m
* **Duration**: 1 day per caster level

This spell causes a chosen humanoid character in range to view you as a trusted friend. The target of this spell is allowed a magic saving throw to negate this effect. Successful save will also mean that the target knows about the spell being cast. The target will also know about the spell when it breaks for any reason, including the end of duration.

The charmed individuals will generally perform all reasonable requests made by the spellcaster, and will generally try to defend the spellcaster. They may put themselves at risk, but they will not go against their own nature - and they will not want to throw their life away lightly. If commanded to act against their own nature or perform any suicidal or harmful order, the target will obviously refuse, and will be allowed an additional magic save at a +5 bonus to break the spell. If the spellcaster attempts to hurt the charmed target, the spell will be immediately broken.
