# Darkness

* **Range**: 30m
* **Duration**: 1 minute per caster level

This spell creates an impossible to see through, 10 m radius sphere of pure darkness, originating at the target point. Anyone inside this sphere can't see anything but the color black - any form of darkvision abilities won't be of any use. From the outside view it is also not possible to see what is inside the area of this spell.
