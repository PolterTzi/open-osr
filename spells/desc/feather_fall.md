# Feather Fall

* **Range**: 30m
* **Duration**: 1 minute per caster level

Causes the target to fall slowly instead of at a normal velocity - at a rate of at most 3 meters per 6 seconds (1 combat round). This can be used to prevent fall damage. For each caster level beyond the first, an additional target is possible.
