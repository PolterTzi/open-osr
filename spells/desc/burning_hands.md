# Burning Hands

* **Range**: self
* **Duration**: instant

The caster creates a 3 meter long up to 120 degree wide fan of fire originating at their hands, dealing 1d6 damage in anyone in the area, increased by an additional 1d6 for every three caster levels (2d6 at level 3, 3d6 at level 6, and so on). A successful reflex saving throw halves the damage taken.

Unlike most spells, Burning Hands can't be cast with just a single hand - it requires both hands to touch each other to properly direct the flames. GM may allow one handed casting at their discretion, but this will usually result in the caster burning themselves in the process.
