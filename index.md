# OpenOSR

**Note: Currently work in progress and not yet ready for any serious gameplay**

OpenOSR is an open-source RPG system, based on the BX edition of the world's most famous roleplaying system. This system is designed to be hackable - you can extend it, cut stuff from it, change things, and you can even base off your own separate RPG system off it.

This system follows the ideas of the Old School Renaissance, and should be compatibile with most OSR content available. Some of this content may require conversions - but these should be easily done on the fly.
